                By default the notes are shown in the order they were created, with the most recent ones first.
                You can change the order is which YellowNotes are shown, by set the sorting on any of the other columns (when shown).
                Apply filtering on the other columns, to limit the notes shown in the list.
                The sorting and filtering put in place is preserved until you change them. This way you can tailor what appears in your feed.
