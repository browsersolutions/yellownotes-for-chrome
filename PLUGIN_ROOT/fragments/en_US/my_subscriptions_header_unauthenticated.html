      Here are the YellowNote feeds, or distributionlists you are subscribing to. You can add, remove, suspend or activate any and all subscriptions.</p>
  
    Currently you are not signed in to the Yellow Notes Cloud and there are some limitations for anonymous users. 

    For example: Many feeds will not be accessible to anonymous users. The feeds you subscribe up to while anonymous will not be remain subscribed to you when you are signed in; you will have to subscribe again as an authenticated user. 
    However, when you logout, the subscribtion you had as an authenticated user as still in place. This is because as an anonymous user the subscribtion is stored with an indetifier that is unique to your browser.
